# Experimental_Cosmology
My Summer Research 2015

This code that I wrote for the Columbia Experiemtal Cosmology Laboratory should
be able to find all the resonators picked up by the detector.

Additionally, the code includes a section on fitting each resonator to a
Lorentz-Function ( via the Least Squares Fitting Method). You can check how well
each resonator fits into the Lorentzian, and thus find out if it is a resonator,
or just random noise.
